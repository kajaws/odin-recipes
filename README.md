# Odin Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! In this project, I'll be creating a simple webpage to showcase and share delicious recipes. As I progress through the iterations, I'll learn and demonstrate the following skills:

## Iteration 1: Initial Structure

- Create an HTML file with basic structure.
- Add an `<h1>` heading for the main page.

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page

- Create individual HTML files for recipes.
- Link recipe pages from the main index.html.
- Structure the recipe pages with an `<h1>` heading.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

- Display images of the finished dishes.
- Provide descriptions of the recipes.
- List the required ingredients.
- Outline the steps for preparing each dish.

## Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

- Expand the project by adding additional recipes.
- Ensure links to new recipes are included on the main index page.
- Organize the links, perhaps using an unordered list.
